Snake Game
===========================
By Ibrahim Abdur-Rauf <ibrauf@umich.edu>

My own recreation of the traditional Snake game that first appeared in 1997 on the Nokia 6110. The objective of the game is to eat a much food as possible without colliding into yourself or going out of bounds. The program incorporates a score status bar, a snake growing algorithm, and utilizes spawning and collision mechanisms.
